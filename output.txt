Today was a complete mess! I woke up late, and to top it off, my car wouldn't start. "*hit", I muttered as I tried to fix it. It's like everything was fucked from the start. Then, to make matters worse, I heard someone shout, "Hey, d*ck, watch where you're going!" as I almost bumped into a passerby on the street. My friend tried to calm me down, saying, "It's okay, everyone has days like these." But it felt like he was just f**king with me. What a b*tch of a day!
